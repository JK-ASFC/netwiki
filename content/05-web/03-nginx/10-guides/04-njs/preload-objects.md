For each incoming request njs creates a separate virtual machine. This brings a lot of benefits such as predictable memory consumption or requests isolation. However, as all requests are isolated, if a request handler needs to access some data, it has to read it by itself. This is not efficient especially when the amount of data is large.

To address this limitation, a preloaded shared object was introduced. Such objects are created immutable and do not have prototype chains: their values cannot be changed, properties cannot be added or removed.

## Working with preload objects

Here are some examples of how to work with a preload object in njs:

- access properties by name:

  ```
  preloaded_object.prop_name
  preloaded_object[prop_name]
  ```
- enumerate properties:

  ```c
  for (i in preloaded_object_name) {
      ...
  }
  ```
- apply non-modifying built-in methods using `call()`:

  ```
  Array.prototype.filter.call(preloaded_object_name, ...)
  ```
